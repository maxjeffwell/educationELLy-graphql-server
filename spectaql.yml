    GraphQL API for the EducationELLy English Language Learner Management System.

    ## Overview
    This API provides endpoints for managing students, user authentication, and AI-powered educational features.

    ## Authentication
    Most operations require authentication via JWT token. Include the token in the `x-token` header:
    ```
    x-token: <your-jwt-token>
    ```

    ## Getting Started
    1. Sign up for an account using the `signUp` mutation
    2. Sign in to receive your JWT token using the `signIn` mutation
    3. Use the token in subsequent requests
